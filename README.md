This is a repository full of random bits of code I have written for various assingments, projects, and classes over time.  Some of the code I am not allowed to share and has been omited due to it being private, homework solutions, copyrighted code that I cannto distribute, or secret/classified information.  If you have any questions or need to see something that you think might have been redacted, feel free to email me at [rjacoby00@icloud.com](mailto:rjacoby00@icloud.com).
